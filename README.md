# Safebox
Welcome to Safebox, your trusted insecure secret keeper.

In order to benefit of Safebox's feature, you will have to get through
a set of challenges.

## Challenge 1
Rooted devices cannot use the app. Find a way to use the app while having root access.

## Challenge 2
The pin to enter the secret vault is randomly generated by the app and stored externally.

Hint: look for a file named `vault_pin`. Get some inspiration from the source code.

## Challenge 3
You will have to press the buttons in a specific order to move on to the next challenge.
If you don't get it right, you can use the reset button.

Hint: Look at the source code.

Hint 2: Everything is not what it seems.

## Challenge 4
The flag is stored somewhere in the source code, find it to move to the next challenge.

Hint: Look for a `XOR` operation and try to mimic it to find the flag.

## Challenge 5
The java code isn't telling the whole story anymore ... The flag validation is handled by a `native` method.

Hint: try looking for code not written in java.

# :tada: Congrats
You got to the vault, now you can unsafely store your secrets.
